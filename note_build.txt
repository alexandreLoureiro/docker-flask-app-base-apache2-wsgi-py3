----To remind of setup----
Once code is pushed to github,
service set up under repository at github will notify the docker hub;
Docker hub will start auto build (result: new built image),
and once ready will notify microbadger.com to update its info
(result: badges info, related to microbadger.com, displayed 
by README.md at github show up-to-date details).

  
PS! Every commit triggers autobuild at docker hub;
every finished build triggers update request to microbadger.com.
PS! Without updating related info at microbadger.com, badges info given 
at the top of README.md would be outdated/wrong.
